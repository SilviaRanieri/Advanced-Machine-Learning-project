# Advanced-Machine-Learning-project

The purpose of this project is the identification of a model for the weather recognition task. The application of the model is designed to be performed on IoT sensor devices, equipped with low computational power, to increase driving safety by alarming the driver in the event of unfavorable weather conditions. The implementation of the model was therefore focused on the use of lightweight models such as the Mobile Net and calibrated pruning techniques to reduce the model's memory weight and increase its execution speed while limiting the decrease in performance on the model. 'accuracy of the classification.
